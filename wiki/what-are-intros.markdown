# What Are Intros
Intros are demos with a limited size. Popular size formats for intros are 64Kb, 4Kb, and in between. Intros that are less than a kilobyte are usually called "bytetros". What's a demo?

### From the Old school PC demoscene FAQ:

> A Demo is a program that displays a sound, music, and light show, usually in 3D. Demos are very fun to watch, because they seemingly do things that aren't possible on the machine they were programmed on.
> Essentially, demos "show off". They do so in usually one, two, or all three of three following methods:
> * They show off the computer's hardware abilities (3D objects, multi-channel sound, etc.)
> * They show off the creative abilities of the demo group (artists, musicians)
> * They show off the programmer's abilities (fast 3D shaded polygons,complex motion, etc.)
> Demos are an art form. They blend mathematics, programming skill, and creativity into something incredible to watch and listen to.
